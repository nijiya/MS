* This package represents a multi-objective genetic path planning algorithm. Inputs and visualizations 
look like MOA* and MOD* Lite.
* mogpp stands for "Multi-Objective Genetic Path Planning"

INFO
Project Name stands for "Multi Objective Moving Target Genetic Path Planning"

//add IEEETran.layout class by "sudo apt-get install texlive-publishers" and reconfigure lyx.

NOTES
#1: Each individual is a solution, a path from start cell to goal cell.
#2: To find this solution, an algorithm should be executed (which finds paths from start to goal cells)
	#i: at each iteration of this algorithm, first; obstacles moves simultaneously, and then agent moves through to the goal 
	#ii: Target cell is always immobile.
#3: Agent can goes crosswise, but and obstacles can go only up-down and left-right.


Crossover?? (Path based? Find intersected two paths and xover from intersection point?)
Fitness Function?? (# of cells + total weights of each cells in the path?)
Mutation?? (probably will not included)
