Technical content of the paper is generally good, but could be improved along the following lines.

- A running example could help a lot the reader to better understand the content of Sections IV-C and IV-D. Please add a small example (possibly related to that of Figures 1 and 2) and show the main steps of the algorithm on this example.

- Experimental: It would have been nice to see an experimental comparison (relative both to quality and execution time) between paths generated by MOD* Lite and paths generated by classical planners optimizing only one of the two objectives.

** Concerning experimental results.

** You consider in your experiments 2 objectives. What with more than
 2 ? Is the comparison with MOA* still to your advantage if you consider
 multi-objective with "multi-" corresponding to more than 2 ?

1.    There are some other papers about the "incremental multiobjective path planning", such as "Unmanning UAVs ��� Addressing Challenges in On Board Planning and Decision Making", "Multiobjective Path Planning under Dynamic Uncertain Environment", "A multi-objective exploration strategy for mobile robots", and so on.
Could you explain the difference between your work and others? What are the unique characteristics of your work? Could you compare with the reference [16]?
