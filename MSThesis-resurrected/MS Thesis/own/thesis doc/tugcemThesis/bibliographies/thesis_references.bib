the foundations for a number of problems
of interest to AI researchers studying automated
planning and reinforcement learning.
In this paper, we summarize results
regarding the complexity of solving MDPs
and the running time of MDP solution algorithms.
We argue that, although MDPs
can be solved efficiently in theory, more study
is needed to reveal practical algorithms for
solving large problems quickly. To encourage
future research, we sketch some...},
