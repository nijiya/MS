Subject: CYB-E-2014-05-0513.R1

Dear Prof. Polat:

Your manuscript MOD* Lite: An Incremental Path Planning Algorithm Taking Care of Multiple Objectives CYB-E-2014-05-0513.R1 has gone through the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics  review process and publication is recommended for acceptance IF some minor revisions are made.  The paper will not be sent out again to the reviewers - the  Associate Editor and I will make sure the changes have been made, and return a final decision.

Below are summary comments explaining minor revisions from the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics reviewers. It is recommended that you resubmit your manuscript as revised in accordance with the reviewer  comments. You should submit your comments, detailing the changes you have made, in the comments to Editor-in-Chief box, accessible when the manuscript is resubmitted. Please also include them as the first page(s) of the revised manuscript.

Please also be aware of TCYB page length policy with a cap of 12 pages plus two additional pages with a charge of $175/page, for a regular paper,  provided that you promise to pay the bill after the publication. No paper over 14 pages in the IEEE two-column format will be accepted.

I noticed that there is NO reference from this very journal. To establish a close tie with this publication, we would appreciate if you could identify and add a few relevant references published in the transactions in recent years, if there are any and there is space in the manuscript, for the best interest of the authors as well as the journal.

Please electronically resubmit your manuscript as a regular paper to IEEE Manuscript Central within one month.


Sincerely,

Prof. Jun Wang

What are the contributions of the paper?: This paper proposes the MOD* Lite, which is the multi-objective version of D* Lite method, for robotic path planning in partially observable dynamic environments. The MOD* Lite method is applied to 2D UAV problem, and two objectives, minimizations of length of path and risk of path, are considered. The simulation results have demonstrated the efficiency of MOD* Lite in terms of path length and safety.

What are the additional ways in which the paper could be improved?: To review this paper, I learned something about path planning.

Thank you for the authors!

I accept the responses to my comments, but I still have a question.
In the 8th comment, page 17, the authors stated that "The path costs are updated as (15, 260), (18, 230) and (23, 200) where none of the path costs could dominate
each other." However, the authors did not explain why the agent select the (18, 230). Please explain it.
